		{
			"que": "Why my rank is changing each time I refresh the page?",
			"ans": "The Rank iQ gives you a real-time analysis of your Rank which keeps getting updated as the number of students using this predictor keeps getting increased. So students are advised to check their ranks again after a certain time interval to know their updated rank."
		},
		{
			"que": "What happens if the marks are same for multiple students? How rank is calculated?",
			"ans": "Let’s say topper has 127 marks, so his rank is 1. Now, there are three students with 126 marks, then all of them will see their rank as 2. The student with 125 marks will see his rank as 1+3+1=5."
		},
		{
			"que": "Do the total number of students increase after old student rechecking with the same URL?",
